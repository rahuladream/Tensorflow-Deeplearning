# Intro to Tensoflow for Deep Learning

Intro to Advance Deep Learning for Software Engineers only.

Please note that the course and notebook only designed for software engineers who are just starting or having an experience of Software Engineer.

# Why Tensorflow & Keras

Tensorflow become quite popular these decade and also the community is quite big. Keras provide high end api to solve most of the inner
